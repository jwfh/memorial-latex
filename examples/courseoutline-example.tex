% The courseoutline class currently accepts two options:

%   - engineering:  Use the names "Engineering", "Faculty of Engineering", etc.
%                   in the relevant places and emit the Faculty's policy on
%                   academic integrity ("Like Professional Engineers...").
%   - safelabs:     Don't emit a "Lab Safety" section even if a lab slot is
%                   declared with \lab{}{}. This is intended for use with
%                   computer labs (not electrical, structural, chemical labs).

\section{Major Topics}

\begin{itemize}
\item Widget fundamentals
\item Widget analysis
\item Widgets and society
\item Advanced widget design
\end{itemize}


\section{Learning Outcomes}

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
\item explain the theoretical foundations of widgets,
\item analyze the design and application of a standard widget,
\item design simple widgets,
\item synthesize widget specifications and
\item evaluate the fitness of a widget for a specification.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Assessment}

Assignments will be given \dots
Written evaluation will take place in October and during the final exam
weeks (8--17~Dec).
The month of November should largely be used for project work.
